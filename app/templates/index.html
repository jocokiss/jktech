                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello there! My name is Joseph Kiss and I'm excited to share my journey with you. At 32 years old, I
                    recently switched careers from the construction industry to the tech world, and I'm eager to explore
                    this new path. Starting May 2, I'll be working as a junior data engineer, and I couldn't be
                    happier!</p>

                <p>My passion for math, physics, and science led me to pursue civil engineering in college, and I worked
                    as a project manager in my family's construction business for several years. While I enjoyed the
                    work, I always knew there was something else out there for me.</p>

            <section>

                <p>That's when I decided to take a leap and pursue my interest in computer science. I taught myself
                    Python, SQL and Flask, among other skills. It's been a challenging but incredibly rewarding journey,
                    and I can't wait to see what new challenges lie ahead.</p>
